const Experience = <>I have extensive commercial experience as a backend developer, primarily using Python and SQL. During my current tenure, I have worked on my company's proprietary data modeling software,
  developing new features in an agile environment. I wrote clean, testable code, adhering to the best practices of Software Development. Additionally, I ran many different
  products as part of the SAAS offered to clients. I used a diverse range of technologies and have been exposed to different architectures and paradigms. 
  I have since become more interested in fullstack development and Web3 and
  have been steadily learning and building projects to further my understanding.</>

The most recent and relevant of my current projects
is this very web application made with Next.js 13. Prior to this, most of my projects and development experience has been 
in Python and Solidity. I began reading into React initially to create a ui for a smart contract I was writing,
and then decided to learn Next.js. I have thorougly enjoyed using the Next.js framework and am excited for all the 
future projects and applications that I will create with it.

The next project is not just a single project, but a collection of projects (Smart Contracts) created whilst following 
Patrick Collins' Solidity course. <br />

The projects are all created using Solidity and Python, with the web3.py library and using tools like Brownie and Ganache
for local development. I used both the Infura and Alchemy API to deploy and interact with the smart contracts and Oracles 
like Chainlink to get external data into the Dapps. 

I am now in the process of progressing through Alchemy university's learning program with Solidity and Javascript and 
my Github should be updated shortly...

<a className="font-bold font-mono text-purple-500" href="https://github.com/jamoowen/breadth_first_search/">Github link </a> <br/>
This was a project I completed to satisfy my curiousity of searching Algorithms and what they are used for in practice.
 <br/>
 The Projects implements the breadth first search algorith, to find the shortest link between any two Hollywood actors.
 It uses an IMDB data source and can prove that there is a maximum of six degrees of Separation between actors. Whilst 
 testing, I found that there was mostly only two to three degrees of separation between most actors which I found extremely 
 Interesting.
