## My App

This is the first Application I have created and deployed using Next.js 13! 
I wrote this app using The next framework alongside Tailwind CSS and the Material Tailwind library for some component inspiration.
This project is intended to be set up for CI/CD and so I will continuously add features as time progresses!

It was an absolute pleasure dipping my toe into Next and its most definitely an area which I will continue mastering and building things with.
